# MARVEL

MARVEL (MAp Reduce Visual Environment Laboratory) is a prototype system where the
user is initially provided with a visual representation of a input dataset, encoded as a Spark
distributed data structure. Moreover, he can choose among a list of standard map and
reduce functions and apply it on the distributed data structure, playing a graphical animation
describing the effects of that execution on the same data structure.
